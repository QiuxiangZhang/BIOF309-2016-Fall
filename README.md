Course Description
------------------

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:

1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working python programs using the basic features of the python language 
3. Understand the difference between different sets of objects in the python programmign language (list, dictionary)
4. Do basic data analysis with python using numpy, pandas
5. Plot data using python
6. Write bioinformatics programs utilizing the biopython package

Logistics
---------

This is a 15 week course starting on the 14th September 2016, and finishing on 12th May 2016. Classes will take place between 5:30pm and 7:30pm each Wednesday in the Rathskeller of building ???, room B1C207 within the FAES Academic Center.

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other commitments will occasionally prevent attendance. Class materials will generally be sent to all learners via email.

Most classes will have hands-on tutorials and assignments. Both practice and graded assignments will generally be provided. Graded assignments should be submitted prior to the following class. So that you can follow along during class bringing a laptop to each class is strongly encouraged.

Important dates:

* Oct 7 - Last day to drop/withdraw
* Nov 10 - Last day to change status (credit or audit)

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.** For the course, we will use Python 3. Any python installation should work, but you must be able to install packages. The Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution from Continuum Analytics will likely be the easiest approach to configuring python if you do not already have python installed. The Anaconda installer will automatically install many of the packages we will use during the course.

Recommended Books
-----------------

**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering the skills covered. It is my hope that everyone will be able to complete the assignments and project. If some of the material appears unclear please ask for clarification.

Grading assignments will follow the following rubric:

* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments, meaningful variable names, follows coding conventions: A+
* Program runs, produces correct result: A
* Program runs, produces something close to the correct result: B
* Program runs, does not produce correct result: C
* Program does not run: Incomplete (I)


Grading the final project will follow the following rubric:

* Project description / Specification

  - Goals unclear, difficulty demonstrating functionality (1-3)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed but difficult to follow (4-6)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed (7-9)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are logically presented and clearly communicated (10-12)


* Documentation

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, additional standalone documentation (7-9)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, extensive standalone documentation with example usage (10-12)


* Readability

  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
  - The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
  - The code is fairly easy to read (7-9)
  - The code is well organized and very easy to read (10-12)


* Reusability

  - The code is not organized for reusability (1-3)
  - Some parts of the code could be reused (4-6)
  - Most of the code could be reused (7-9)
  - Each part of the code, and the whole, could be reused (10-12)


* Performance 

  - Program does not run (1-6)
  - Program runs, but does not produce correct output (7-12)
  - Program runs, produces correct output under most conditions (13-18)
  - Program runs, produces correct output with robust error checking (19-24)
